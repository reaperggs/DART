# ðŸŽ¯ DART â€” Daily Algorithm Revision Tracker

Hey there ðŸ‘‹. This is **DART**, a simple web app I made to track my daily algorithm problem revisions using spaced repetition.

No accounts, no frameworks, no backend. Just clean HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with local storage. It lets you:

- Add problem numbers youâ€™ve solved
- See which ones are due for revision (after 1, 3, 7, or 14 days)
- Check them off for the day
- Toggle between light and dark mode
- Works offline because everything's saved in your browser

## Why?

I kept forgetting which LeetCode problems to review, and other tools felt too bloated. So I built my own clean and minimal version.

## Live Demo

Try it here: [https://darttracker.netlify.app/](https://darttracker.netlify.app/)

## Tech Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Local Storage API
